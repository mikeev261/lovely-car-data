with the goal, to bring open and unified sim racing car data to everyone.

## How to
Fetch the data by retrieving the url:
`{version}/data/{simId}/{carId}.json`

* `{version}` is the specific branch of car data. `main` will always have the latest version.
* `{simId}` is the Simhub game id `DataCorePlugin.CurrentGame`
* `{carId}` is the Simhub car id `DataCorePlugin.CarId`

### Name Format

Both `{SimId}` and `{carId}` must adhere to the following naming format:

1. Lowercase
2. Replace accented chars with standard equivalent
3. Replace spaces with hyphen
4. Replace special characters with hyphen
5. Remove double Hyphens
6. Remove leading and trailing hyphens

### Example name formatting

* `F12024 / AIX Racing 24` -> `f12024/aix-racing-24.json`
* `F12024 / Dams ‘23` -> `f1/dams-23.json`
* `AssettoCorsa / alpine_a110_gt4` -> `assettocorsa/alpine-a110-gt4.json`
* `LMU / Algarve Pro Racing 2024` -> `lmu/algarve-pro-racing-2024.json`

### Example code

```
function nameCleaner($cleanName)
{
    // Convert to lowercase
    $cleanName = mb_strtolower($cleanName, 'UTF-8');

    // Replace accented character with standard
    $cleanName = iconv('UTF-8', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT', $cleanName);
    
    // Replace spaces with hyphen
    $cleanName = preg_replace('/\s+/', '-', $cleanName);
    
    // Replace special characters with hyphen
    $cleanName = preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9]/i', '-', $cleanName);
    
    // Replace multiple hyphens with single
    $cleanName = preg_replace('/-+/', '-', $cleanName);
    
    // Clean leading and trailign hyphens
    $cleanName = trim($cleanName, '-');
    
    return $cleanName;
}   
```

### Manifest
A single root manifest at `data/manifest.json` lists all cars, grouped by game.

Structure:
```
{
  "cars": {
    "{simId}": [
      { "carName": "...", "carId": "...", "path": "{simId}/...json" }
    ]
  }
}
```

- Filter by game using the `{simId}` key in `cars`.
- `path` is relative to `data/` and includes the game folder.

See [scripts/MANIFEST_GENERATOR.md](scripts/MANIFEST_GENERATOR.md) for details on regenerating manifests.

## Changelog
Read the [changelog](changelog.md) to keep track of the format updates.

## Output Data Format
Every compiled JSON file in the `data/` directory (which consumers interact with) is formatted as follows:

``` 
# carName               (String) - The full human readable car name
# carId                 (String) - The carId property as it appears in SimHub
# carClass              (String) - The car's 3-5 letter class shorthand
# ledNumber             (Int)    - The car's in game number of telemetry LED's
# redlineBlinkInterval  (Int|Array) - The speed at which the redline blinks in ms. If an array, it matches the redline stages.
# ledColor                         An array of the led color
  # redline1(:Value)    (String) - (Optional) Stage 1 color name or HEX value for the red line
  # redlineN(:Value)    (String) - (Optional) Stage N color name or HEX value for the red line
  # led1color(:Value)   (String) - A color name or HEX value for LED 1
  # led2color(:Value)   (String) - A color name or HEX value for LED 2
  # led3color(:Value)   (String) - A color name or HEX value for LED 3
  # ledNcolor(:Value)   (String) - A color name or HEX value for LED N
# ledRpm                           An array of all the RPM data per gear
  # gear(:Key)          (String) - The gear number
    # redline1(:Value)  (Int)    - (Optional) Stage 1 RPM red line value per gear
    # redlineN(:Value)  (Int)    - (Optional) Stage N RPM red line value per gear
    # led1rpm(:Value)   (Int|Str)- The RPM value (or value range) for LED 1
    # led2rpm(:Value)   (Int|Str)- The RPM value (or value range) for LED 2
    # led3rpm(:Value)   (Int|Str)- The RPM value (or value range) for LED 3
    # ledNrpm(:Value)   (Int|Str)- The RPM value (or value range) for LED N
# carSettings                      (Optional) An array of all the available Car Settings
  # property(:Simhub)   (String) - The SimHub Property Name
    # min               (Int)    - Lowest possible setting
    # max               (Int)    - Highest possible setting

```

## Templating and Scripts

To reduce duplication, some games (like `lmu`) use a templating system. 
Source data is maintained in `src_data/{simId}/` as `.jsonc` files. 

### Source Template Format
The `src_data` files use the same schema as above, but with the addition of a `variants` array and support for comments. 

``` 
# variants                         (Optional) An array of car variants. Each object will be compiled into its own file, inheriting and overriding properties from this base template.
  # carName             (String) - The full human readable car name
  # carId               (String) - The carId property as it appears in SimHub
  # fileName            (String) - The target generated filename
  # carClass            (String) - The car's 3-5 letter class shorthand
  # ...                            Any other property to override for this variant
```

**Important:** Do not edit the generated files in `data/lmu/` directly. Always edit the `src_data/lmu/` templates.

### Build Scripts

- **`python scripts/build_profiles.py`**: Compiles all `.jsonc` templates in `src_data/` into standard `.json` files in `data/`, expanding variants and stripping comments.
- **`python scripts/rpm_shadow.py`**: A helper tool to calculate and append relative RPM percentage shadow tables as comments to the source `.jsonc` files. This helps in verifying RPM scaling.
  - `--add`: Add shadow tables where missing.
  - `--refresh`: Recalculate all shadow tables.
  - `--remove`: Remove all shadow tables.
  - `--log LABEL`: Snapshot current RPM data into log files (in `src_data/lmu/log/`) with a timestamp and the provided label, keeping a historical record of BOP/RPM changes.

## Color Names
To preserve consistency among LED profiles, you can use any of the offical **HTML Color Names** as listed in the [W3 Schools HTML Color Names](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp) list or add you custom **HEX RGB** color code.

## Contributing
To maintain properly formatted files, I've implemented - and require - a `pre-commit` script, that will prettify the JSON files and thus properly track changes to them.

### 1. Install Pre-Commit Hook
Before you can run hooks, you need to have the pre-commit package manager installed. You can do so by following the instructions on the [official pre-commit website](https://pre-commit.com/#installation), or just install it using the following command:

```
brew install pre-commit
```

Homebrew not your thing? Read more on the [official pre-commit website](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).


### 2. Install Git Hook Scripts

Once installed, run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts

```
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Test & Finish
You're all set as far as tooling is concerned. Every time you make a commit, the `pre-commit` script will make sure the files are properly formatted and are prettified. 

It's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all of the files when adding new hooks (usually pre-commit will only run on the changed files during git hooks). Running `pre-commit run --all-files` will have a pass at everything, and if all is well, you should see something like the below. 

```
$ pre-commit run --all-files
check json...............................................................Passed
pretty format json.......................................................Passed
```
